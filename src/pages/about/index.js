      <Paragraph>
        I started around 2003 and at that time I was a huge Charmed fanatic. None of my friends
        watched it nor had the interest. Than I found this website Charmed: The Prophecy, an
        online community with many members. I saw how well it was designed and I was amazed.
        I started talking to one person in particular, Ana, and she introduced me to the whole
        creative scene.

        On the same community I talked to this guy, Kris. He told me he had his own website.
        I never knew someone who owned a website; I was amazed. I got into the free hosting
        websites (Geocities, Angelfire, etc.), but I wanted to learn more. I was than
        introduced to his host, Jaxon. She taught me the HTML basics. My skills in web and
        graphic design advanced through time as I began learning other languages
        (CSS, XHTML, PHP, MySQL, etc). From there itâ€™s all history.
