blurb: Displaying the console log on a mobile device.
description: >-
  A tool for programmers to see a viewable console in the browser. Meant to be
  used on mobile devices and/or browsers that do not support the console object.
  The script uses device detection (user agent sniffing) and if the console
  object is undefined; It then overwrites the console object. This is a bare
  bones console, not a replacement for the browsers console. Certain limitations
  and functionality that the browser's console has will not be implemented in
  order to keep the script file size down.
