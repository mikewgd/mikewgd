A tool for programmers to see a viewable console in the browser. Meant to be used on mobile devices and/or browsers that do not support the console object. The script uses device detection (user agent sniffing) and if the console object is undefined; It then overwrites the console object. This is a bare bones console, not a replacement for the browsers console. Certain limitations and functionality that the browser's console has will not be implemented in order to keep the script file size down.
