A complete redesign prototype for Converse’s website including a living styleguide based on atomic design. As a head developer on this project I gave tasks to fellow colleagues on what components to develop. Created a custom build script using Apache and Yahoo that would concatenate, minify and compile JavaScript and CSS. This was before there were build tools (Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, etc…) This was one of the first projects that I did responsive development for.
