A user can book appointments directly on the platform. You can create an account with your Facebook or Google as well! When your request is made a text message is sent to the phone number you have provided via **Talkus** and a welcome email sent from **SES**. 

The site is architected around using **Higher-Order Components**, state is managed through **Redux** and effects using **Saga**.
