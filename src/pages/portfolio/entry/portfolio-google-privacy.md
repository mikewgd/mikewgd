A site built explaining Googleâ€™s dedication to keeping your data private and updated security. The entire site is built within the **Goro** infrastructure and the front-end is built in Angular. 

All animations were done by using Bodymovin plugin, which was integrated as an Angular plugin for better usability across the site.
